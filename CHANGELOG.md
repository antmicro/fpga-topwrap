## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Added a new YAML field type that resolves and serializes paths relatively to the YAML file itself and supports loading remote files (`http(s)://` URLs) or files from a user repo with the given name
- While loading a design file (e.g. `topwrap kpm_client/build -d design.yaml`) all required IP Cores are now automatically parsed from the file and it's no longer required to provide them manually on the command line
- Automatically generated YAML files are now more concise thanks to some arrays being serialized inline, instead of each element always occupying its own line
- Added "IP Cores", "Externals", and "Constants" layers to the GUI which you can hide/show from the settings
- Nox session for downloading and packaging FuseSoc libraries
- Support Python 3.13 and dropped support for Python 3.8
- Added tests to CLI commands
- Added job for building and running the KPM server
- Added to config option for choosing a location where KPM server should be built
- All in one command `topwrap gui` for building, starting the KPM server and connecting the client to it.
- Automatic dataflow saving with each change to the graph in KPM. This ensures that the state is preserved when the page is reloaded.

### Changed

- The order of fields in generated KPM specifications are now deterministic
- Topwrap's builtin cores and interfaces have been repackaged into a user repository automatically loaded at start named `builtin`
- All YAML files internal to Topwrap (examples, tests, built-in repo) now only use the `.yaml` extension
- Default location for built KPM server from `./build/` to `$XDG_CACHE_HOME/topwrap/kpm_build`

### Fixed

- Resolving IP Core YAML paths defined in a design description now works relative to the location of the design file instead of the current working directory
    - Except when using the "Load file/Save file" options in the GUI
- Resolved an issue where IP Core node names in the GUI were parsed from the yaml description file name.
- Resolved an issue with YAML files produced by `topwrap parse`, where unnecessary double hyphens (`--`) appeared in signal definitions
- Changed how validation is done in topwrap in order to support hierarchical designs and check for more errors while creating design
