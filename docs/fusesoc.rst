FuseSoC
=======

Toprwap uses FuseSoC to automate project generation and build process.

A ``Core`` file is needed in order to generate a project. The file can be generated from a template using :class:`FuseSocBuilder` class. The ``Core`` file contains information about source files and synthesis tools.

Core file template
------------------
A template for the core file is bundled with Topwrap (``templates/core.yaml.j2``).
You may need to edit the file to change the backend tool, set additional ``Hooks`` and change the FPGA part name or other parameters.
By default, :class:`FuseSocBuilder` searches for the template file in the directory you work in, so you should first copy the template into the project's location.

Using the FuseSocBuilder
------------------------

Here's an example of how to generate a simple project:

.. code-block:: python

    from fpga_topwrap.fuse_helper import FuseSocBuilder
    fuse = FuseSocBuilder()

    # add source of the IPs used in the project
    fuse.add_source('DMATop.v', 'verilogSource')
    
    # add source of the top file
    fuse.add_source('top.v', 'verilogSource')

    # specify the names of the Core file and the directory where sources are stored
    # generate the project
    fuse.build('build/top.core', 'sources')


Now you can run FuseSoC to generate bitstream and program FPGA:

.. code-block:: bash
    
    fusesoc --cores-root build run project_1

This requires having the suitable backend tool in your ``PATH`` (Vivado, for example).
