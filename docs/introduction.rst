Introduction
============

Topwrap is a generator for HDL wrappers and top modules.

Wrappers are used to standardize names of ports that belong to an interfaces (e.g. UART, AXI etc.)

Top modules connect IPs and/or Wrappers by either ports` names or interfaces` names to ease connecting multi-wire interfaces without the need to connect each wire separately.

nMigen
------

Topwrap uses nMigen to generate HDLs. It's a toolbox for building complex digital hardware.
See `nMigen Github <https://github.com/nmigen/nmigen>`_ for more information.


FuseSoC
-------
FuseSoC is used as build abstraction tool. It automates Vivado project generation and runs Vivado pipelines to generate bitstream and program FPGAs. It can be installed using `pip`. For more information visit `FuseSoC Github <https://github.com/olofk/fusesoc>`_.
