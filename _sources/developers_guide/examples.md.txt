# Examples

:::{note}
The basic usage of examples are explained in the [Getting started](../getting_started.md) section.
:::

The examples provided with this project cover very simple designs through to complex fully synthesizable cores.

They are sorted by increasing levels of complexity and the number of used features, e.g.:

- 101: minimal base design
- 102: introduce user to parameters
- 103: introduce user to slicing
- 104: introduce user to interfaces
- 105: etc.

Developers are encouraged to create/add new examples in the same manner, as simple examples are used to teach how to use this tool and demonstrate its features. Real-world use cases are also welcome to show that the implementation is mature enough to handle practical designs.
