# Installing Topwrap

## 1. Install required system packages

:::{warning}
The script below requires root privileges as it directly interfaces with your filesystem and package manager.

Running scripts and executables as root without first verifying their contents can pose significant security risks. Always ensure their integrity and source before execution.
:::

```bash
curl -fO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/antmicro/topwrap/refs/heads/main/install-deps.sh
chmod +x ./install-deps.sh
sudo ./install-deps.sh
```

## 2. Install the Topwrap user package

**Recommended**: Use [pipx](https://pipx.pypa.io/stable/) to directly install Topwrap as a user package:

```bash
pipx install "topwrap[parse]@git+https://github.com/antmicro/topwrap"
```

If you can't use pipx, you can use regular pip instead. It may be necessary to do it in a Python virtual environment, such as [venv](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html):

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install "topwrap[parse]@git+https://github.com/antmicro/topwrap"
```

## 3. Verify the installation

Make sure that Topwrap was installed correctly and is available in your shell:

```bash
topwrap --help
```

This should print out the help string with Topwrap subcommands listed out.
